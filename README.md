# Interactive Sliders for Matplotlib

This repo contains an approach to implementing interactive sliders to control parameters of a
line plotted with matplotlib. Even better, there's also a version which outputs your interactive plot
as HTML/JS using d3.

## Jupyter notebook
Check out the jupyter notebook version in the sliderPluginNotebook.ipynb file  (You'll need to provide your own dataset).

## HTML/JS
Output a plot to HTML/JS using the sliderPluginHTML.ipynb file

### Note:
The HTML version is a little clunkier than the Jupyter notebook version. Hopefully, it can be improved
with future iterations
